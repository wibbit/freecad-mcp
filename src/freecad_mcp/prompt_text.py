ASSET_CREATION_STRATEGY = """
Asset Creation Strategy for FreeCAD MCP

When creating content in FreeCAD, always follow these steps:

0. Before starting any task, always use get_objects() to confirm the current state of the document.

1. Utilize the parts library:
   - Check available parts using get_parts_list().
   - If the required part exists in the library, use insert_part_from_library() to insert it into your document.

2. If the appropriate asset is not available in the parts library:
   - Create basic shapes (e.g., cubes, cylinders, spheres) using create_object().
   - Adjust and define detailed properties of the shapes as necessary using edit_object().

3. Always assign clear and descriptive names to objects when adding them to the document.

4. Explicitly set the position, scale, and rotation properties of created or inserted objects using edit_object() to ensure proper spatial relationships.

5. After editing an object, always verify that the set properties have been correctly applied by using get_object().

6. If detailed customization or specialized operations are necessary, use execute_code() to run custom Python scripts.

Only revert to basic creation methods in the following cases:
- When the required asset is not available in the parts library.
- When a basic shape is explicitly requested.
- When creating complex shapes requires custom scripting.
